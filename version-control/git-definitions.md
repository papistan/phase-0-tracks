# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is the function of being able to save a collection of changes to a file at different points in time. This is useful so that you do not lose previous versions of your file that may be useful later on. Or if you have a bug, you can go back a version and start from scratch or modify using older versions. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a new copy of a file that you can modify and create a new line of version control on. You would use this so that you can break off and try new things, while someone else modifies their branch, making collections of changes. These can be merged later. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
Commit is saving your changes as a new point of record in version control. A good commit message uses a short line summarizing the change, in easy to read, clear language. If more is needed, summarize in one line on top, skip a line and write more. 


* What is a merge conflict?
Merge conflict is when the same line has been altered in a different branch and you try to merge them.
