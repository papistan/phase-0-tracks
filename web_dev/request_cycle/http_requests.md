What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?
- GET - Requests data from a specified resource [used ]
- POST - Submits data to be processed to a specified resource

GET might be used to request info to download a website. 
POST used to submit info to fill out a form or create a profile, etc. 

Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?
cookies are information sent to the user's browswer to remain while on that site. It could be used to help remember that you are logged in, authenticated so that the website can safely send you info when you request it. It could save your checkout info, credit card, shipping, profile, etc. 

When the server sends requested info it also sends cookie info.
